		<h2><marquee>AND MORE KNOWLAGE OF INDIAN DANCE :-</marquee></h2> <p>India is a land of diversities. Various climatic conditions have made India a diverse</P>
		country. In all spheres of Indian life diversities are clearly visible. These diversities have made the Indian culture a unique one.</P>
		Like all other aspects of life, the dance forms of India are also varied and different. There are many types of dance forms in India,</P>
		from those which are deeply religious in content to those which are performed on small occasions. </P>
		<br><br>
		<P>The Indian dances are broadly divided into Classical dances and folk dances. The Classical dances of India are usually spiritual </P>
		in content. Though the folk dances of India are also spiritual and religious in content but the main force behind the folk dances </P>
		of India is the celebratory mood. Dances are a form of coherent expression of human feelings. Like the Indian culture, Indian classical</P>
		dances are equally diverse in nature. There are numerous classical dance forms in India and innumerable folk dances.</P>
		Each dance form can be traced to different parts of the country. Each form represents the culture and ethos of a particular region or</P>
		a group of people </P>
		<br><br>

		<P>The most popular classical dance styles of India are Bharatnatyam of Tamil Nadu, Kathakali and Mohiniattam of Kerala, Odissi of Orissa,</P>
		Kathak of Uttar Pradesh, Kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh and Manipuri of Manipur.</P>
